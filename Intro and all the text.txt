The HexProcessing project allows EPROMS to be used as a programmable logic device,
or a waveform generator. Use the GUI to assign pins, choose between supported chips, 
and determine logic functions. Aimed at the maker community, this tools allows you to
repurpose old UV erasable EPROM technology into interesting and useful gadgets. Of particular
focus is the digital multiplication of oscillators to explore the minute differences
of parts-per-million errors present within them.


HOW TO USE:
By default the filename of the output is ProcessingCode.hex (which may be changed on the first
line of the Processing code). Logic execution from a .logic file allows boolean logic
of arbitrary complexity. The filename foo.logic will create a hex file of foo.hex for your
convienience.  

The program uses pins A8 through A11 as memory banks to store multiple functions on a 
single EPROM. Simply drive the pins high or low to access the different memory bank functions. 
All logic must index from the input pins A0 through A7, thus an example logic function might
look like:

A1 && (A2||A3)^A5

All logic used is Javascript boolean logic.

The demo file test.logic may be opened with a simple text editor.
